## Abstract

Glioblastoma remains to be one of the deadliest tumors as of today, being diagnosed in 300,000+ people yearly. 
Optimized and specialized medical treatment has consistently proven to be one of the most effective ways of healing disease in patients, 
and is lackluster when it comes to carcinogenic diseases. 

Clinicians currently use a variety of methods for treating patients with brain tumors, 
however Chemotheray and radiation are most commonly used. While these methods of treatment have been proven tobe effective, they bring tolling 
side effects with them, which in some cases can contribute to surivval rates in patients. 

Having a clear path of the effectiveness of different treatment plans before intervening with the tumor can help patients recieve the most optimized care for their specific need. 
Many clinical trials have shown tumor growth remaining relatively unchanged in patients on a placebo drug, with no intervening with the cancerous tumor. In this project, I introduce a generative
variational autoencoder model, that works in the deep latent space to generate predictive simulations of tumor growth from CT1 segmented MRI scans, in response to either chemotherapy or 
surgical treatment in patients. (The model will soon also include survival rate/predictions, in order to help the patient decide whether it even makes sense for them to go through with chemotherapy.)
